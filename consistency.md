Set rules to maintain consistency in error message, success messaged and data return to frontend. Also 


IMP:   Before start write business logic and controllers, please write test condition for the same. As this will help in building better error handling and getting through the edge cases which can be exploited or lead to a bug in program.

REST API route naming conventions focus on clarity, consistency, and resource-oriented design. Adhering to these conventions improves readability and ease of use for developers interacting with the API.
Key Principles:

    Use Nouns for Resources:
    URIs should represent resources (entities) using nouns, not verbs. HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) define the action.
        Good: /users, /products
        Bad: /getUsers, /createProduct 
    Use Plural Nouns for Collections:
    When representing a collection of resources, use plural nouns. For a single instance, either use a singular noun (if the resource is inherently singular) or access it via its ID within the plural collection.
        Collection: /users, /products
        Single Resource: /users/{id}, /products/{id} 
    Use Lowercase and Hyphens:
    All URI paths should be lowercase. Use hyphens (-) to separate words for improved readability (kebab-case). Avoid underscores (_) or camelCase.
        Good: /user-profiles, /order-items
        Bad: /user_profiles, /userProfiles 
    Structure Hierarchically:
    Reflect the relationships between resources using forward slashes (/) to indicate hierarchy.
        Example: /users/{userId}/orders, /products/{productId}/reviews 
    Avoid File Extensions:
    Do not include file extensions (e.g., .json, .xml) in the URI. Content type negotiation using the Accept header handles data format.
    Version Your API:
    Include a version in the base path to allow for future API evolution without breaking existing clients.
        Example: /v1/users, /api/v2/products 
    Use Query Parameters for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination:
    These operations should be handled through query parameters, not by creating separate endpoints.
        Example: /products?category=electronics&sort=price_asc, /users?page=2&limit=10
